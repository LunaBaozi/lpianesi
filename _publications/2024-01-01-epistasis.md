**Abstract**: Epistasis refers to changes in the effect on phenotype of a unit of genetic information, such as a single nucleotide polymorphism or a gene, dependent on the context of other genetic units. Such interactions are both biologically plausible and good candidates to explain observations which are not fully explained by an additive heritability model. However, the search for epistasis has so far largely failed to recover this missing heritability. We identify key challenges and propose that future works need to leverage idealized systems, known biology and even previously identified epistatic interactions, in order to guide the search for new interactions.
