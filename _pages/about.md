Hi, welcome! 

I am a third-year PhD student in the [Genome Data Science](https://gds.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de) research group at Bielefeld University, Germany, and part of the Digital Infrastructure for the Life Sciences ([DILS](https://wiki-dils.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de)) graduate school.

In addition to that, I am also a teaching assistant for several courses.

Previously to becoming a PhD student, I graduated with a BSc in Genomics and a MSc in Artificial Intelligence Systems.

## Research topics

My research focuses on drug discovery, and it sits at the intersection of drug design and artificial intelligence.

I am interested in making drug design better, faster, more accessible, and less reliant on animal testing.
