Hi, welcome! :stars:

I am a PhD student in the [Genome Data Science](https://gds.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de) research group at Bielefeld University, Germany, and part of the Digital Infrastructure for the Life Sciences ([DILS](https://wiki-dils.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de)) graduate school.

I am a teaching assistant for some courses you can find [here](https://lunabaozi.github.io/lpianesi/teaching/), and lucky co-supervisor of two Master students working on molecular synthesizability prediction and molecular activity prediction with graph neural networks.

Previously to becoming a PhD student, I graduated with a BSc in Genomics and a MSc in Artificial Intelligence Systems. 

## Research topics

My research focuses on drug discovery, and it sits at the intersection of drug design and artificial intelligence.

I am interested in making drug design better, faster, more accessible, and less reliant on animal testing.

Recently, I've been working with graph neural networks (GNNs), generative flow networks (GFlowNets), and diffusion models.
