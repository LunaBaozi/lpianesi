I am writing my first ever paper, and I am of course completely lost.

It is an incredibly difficult task, no matter how many years you already spent reading and reviewing other people's papers.

But while going through this exhausting process, I gained clarity about something: I will use LLMs, and I will be transparent about it.

Let's break this down a bit and let's be honest with ourselves: everyone uses LLMs somehow in their work. Be it in the form of coding assistants, literature review assistants, correction of a text written in your second language, general questions...and so on and so forth. I am no special in that sense, because I started using LLMs extensively about two months ago. To be completely honest, I hardly ever used any chatbot before that; wrongly so, I had a quite negative impression of them. 

There are a few things I would like to discuss about in this post, and I will try my best to elaborate on them so that they can result in a coherent picture of the disorganized thoughts I have in mind:
1. Coding is not an easy task for me
2. The wrong understanding of technology as merely an instrument
3. How and how much should we incorporate LLMs into our routine work


## Coding is hard
For the longest time, I had a love-hate relationship with coding. I've always been a book-type-of-kid, and later on studied latin and ancient greek in high school. So for the most part, I didn't have a good impression of technology - books grew me up with a deep fascination for intricate thoughts, romantic feelings, and in general the pleasure of enjoying things in their slowness. But at the same time, I would spend hours as a kid on my dad's super old cathodic tube computer playing videogames me and my sister found in cereal boxes, and later on, sitting besides my dad working on his desk, on a little space he carved for me, on his other old (not as old as the first one) laptop, where I dived deep into YouTube to listen to my favourite artists' songs and learn them by heart, or watch TV series my friends recommended to me. 

So I guess I've always been fascinated by technology, I just didn't fully realize it until during my Bachelor's. There, I struggled A LOT with my first programming exam.

I remember having a full on meltdown at that time, and talking with my friends about how I found programming "sterile", "robotic", and "lacking any meaning" (gosh, sometimes I really could be an arrogant kid). It was only until later during my program, when I attended some courses about statistics (we used R), molecular dynamics (we used simulation softwares), and bioinformatics (we used the terminal and a lot of tools), that I started to appreciate and actually get passionate about all the possibilities that could open when you start using computers. So then I convinced myself I needed to improve, and went on to enroll in an artificial intelligence MSc program. Let's elegantly glide over how hard that was, again, but still, I was now completely caught in the fascination, and that luckily never stopped.

Fascination and passion for something does not imply being good at it, so my struggle with coding still exists. It's just something that doesn't come easy for me, I know that, and it's fine. But it means that sometimes I struggle so much, that I end in a total executive dysfunction [^execdys] episode, which can last for weeks, or even months. Several other external factors have also contributed and still contribute to the occurrence of these events, but let's focus on my personal struggle here. I've always thought that I wasn't "good enough" for programming, that I needed to push myself even harder, or, sometimes, that doing science just wasn't for me, afterall; being in this mindset is such a destructive move for your motivation (expecially during your PhD), and coming to terms with your limits, and recognizing that they are not a quality evaluation of your work nor your person, can really put you in a different perspective.

There's another self-sabotaging mechanism that I've always acted on myself, which is, unsurprisingly, exclusively sabotaging: the idea that if you don't struggle enough when doing something, the result won't be worth it, somehow coupled with the belief that you should be immediately good at something, otherwise that thing is simply not your thing. I guess a lot of PhD students can relate to these "two wolves living inside of you".

To my utter surprise and delight, when I gave in to the idea that I simply didn't need to struggle that hard, and started looking for ways to make my life easier, I found LLM coding agents, and they **worked wonders**---who would've thought!

So now, I jokingly say to my friends that I have "a new supervisor", and show them my shiny new pro subscription plan to Claude.

In the past two months, I've been extensively using Claude, ChatGPT and DeepSeek: 99% of the times, as a coding assistant or conversational agent about coding matters; 1% of the times for other tasks, like content summarization or literature review. I found Claude to be the nicest for my needs, with DeepSeek coming in second place, and ChatGPT in third (based on a subjective and non-rigorous evaluation of the number of hallucinations and the coherence of the response with the request). After this trial period, I can confidently say that coding is not a burden for me anymore, and I actually truly enjoy it. 

So, how did using LLMs changed my experience with programming so radically? It gave me a way to crack two of my personal hardest nuts: initiating tasks, and the fear of asking questions. About the first one, I can say that because I don't have a proper training in computer science from the grounds up, I often fail to break down a problem into pieces and recognize what to start with; about the second, it's partly a personality trait, and partly due to the constant feeling of asking stupid questions because... -> go back to the first point. As many other people have pointed out already (CITATION MISSING), conversing with LLMs as a student almost feels like talking with an infinitely patient and non-judging mentor. I can definitely agree with this feeling.

Consideration which directly leads me to the next paragraph: is technology really *only* a tool?

Much less intellectually than the first post, my latest activities include that I've been playing a lot of Pokémon. I think I caught some rare ones, but I don't really care, they're just cute and I'm having fun.

I'm in my Pokémon era, please don't save me.
